\*\*\*\*# Typography

The typography system is a foundation for readable and visually consistent communication. Use the following as a guideline for laying out paragraphs and text in Threshold styles.

## Base Font

The Threshold type system is built on 8pt scale, and the base font is 14pt (one exception is the 12pt size for XS small buttons; use this rarely).

## Font Color

Text will be difficult to read if it is too close to the background color. With accessible design in mind, we follow the WCAG standard. This maintains an AAA level of contrast ratio, i.e. 7:1 or more between the text and the background color.

## Spacing

# Marketing Alternates

The use case for fonts in this category are for special use only, and not for typical Threshold assets. We want to use Inter the majority of the time so the look of our products and marketing materials are consistent.

However, we can create visual interest in some of our visuals by introducing some other fonts in things like POAPs, Twitter visuals, posters, or more experimental visuals.
